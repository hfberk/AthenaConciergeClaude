# Proactive Messaging & Reminder System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete proactive messaging and reminder system for Athena Concierge. The bot can now:
- ✅ Create reminders from natural language user requests
- ✅ Send scheduled reminders proactively via Slack
- ✅ Send daily proactive recommendations and suggestions
- ✅ Respect user preferences for message frequency
- ✅ Route different types of requests to specialized agents

## Architecture Changes

### New Components Created

#### 1. ProactiveMessagingService (`backend/app/services/proactive_messaging.py`)
**Purpose:** Centralized service for sending messages across all channels

**Key Features:**
- `send_to_person()` - Send message to any user via their preferred channel
- Handles Slack DM channel lookup and message delivery
- Persists messages to database automatically
- Supports Slack, Email (SES), and SMS (future)
- Error handling and logging

**Usage Example:**
```python
from app.services.proactive_messaging import ProactiveMessagingService

messaging_service = ProactiveMessagingService(db)
messaging_service.send_to_person(
    person_id="uuid-here",
    message_text="Your reminder message",
    agent_name="reminder",
    channel_type="slack"
)
```

#### 2. ReminderManagementAgent (`backend/app/agents/reminder_management.py`)
**Purpose:** Handles user requests to create and manage reminders

**Key Features:**
- Natural language parsing using Claude
- Extracts: action, datetime, recurrence from user messages
- Creates `reminder_rules` in database
- Handles both scheduled and lead-time reminders
- Lists pending reminders on request

**Supported Phrases:**
- "Remind me to call John tomorrow at 3pm"
- "Set a reminder for Mom's birthday 2 weeks before"
- "Remind me in 30 minutes"
- "Show my reminders"

#### 3. ProactiveAgent (`backend/app/agents/proactive.py`)
**Purpose:** Generates unsolicited but helpful recommendations

**Key Features:**
- Scans all users for proactive opportunities
- Checks: upcoming dates, stale projects, conversation patterns
- Asks users about message frequency preferences
- Respects user's preferred frequency (daily, weekly, off)
- Tracks last message sent to avoid spam

**Proactive Opportunities:**
- Upcoming dates (1-4 weeks) without associated plans
- Projects not updated in 3+ days
- Seasonal suggestions
- Follow-up opportunities from past conversations

#### 4. ProactiveWorker (`backend/app/workers/proactive_worker.py`)
**Purpose:** Background worker that triggers proactive message scans

**Configuration:**
- Runs daily by default (configurable via `PROACTIVE_CHECK_INTERVAL`)
- Started automatically with main application
- Daemon thread (won't block shutdown)

### Updated Components

#### 5. Orchestrator Agent (`backend/app/agents/orchestrator.py`)
**Changes:**
- Implemented intent detection
- Routes to specialized agents based on intent:
  - `reminder_create` → ReminderManagementAgent
  - `reminder_list` → ReminderManagementAgent.list_reminders()
  - `recommendation` → RecommendationAgent
  - `project_management` → ProjectManagementAgent
  - `general` → Orchestrator (handles directly)

**Intent Keywords:**
- Reminder create: "remind me", "set a reminder", "don't forget"
- Reminder list: "show my reminders", "list reminders"
- Recommendation: "recommend", "suggest", "find me"
- Project: "project", "plan event", "organize"

#### 6. ReminderAgent (`backend/app/agents/reminder.py`)
**Changes:**
- Now uses ProactiveMessagingService for delivery
- Removed manual message DB storage (service handles it)
- Improved error handling
- Supports both date-based and generic reminders

#### 7. SlackUserIntegration (`backend/app/integrations/slack_user.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added `send_proactive_message()` - public method for proactive sending
- Added `get_dm_channel()` - opens DM channel with user
- These methods are used by ProactiveMessagingService

#### 8. Main Application (`backend/app/main.py`)
**Changes:**
- Starts ReminderWorker in background thread
- Starts ProactiveWorker in background thread
- Both workers run as daemon threads

#### 9. Configuration (`backend/app/config.py`)
**New Settings:**
- `reminder_check_interval` - default 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- `proactive_check_interval` - default 86400 seconds (24 hours)

## Database Schema

**No schema changes required!** Uses existing tables:

### reminder_rules
```sql
- reminder_rule_id (uuid, PK)
- date_item_id (uuid, FK - optional)
- comm_identity_id (uuid, FK)
- reminder_type (scheduled | lead_time)
- scheduled_datetime (timestamp)
- lead_time_days (integer)
- sent_at (timestamp - null until sent)
- metadata_jsonb (stores parsed reminder data)
```

### persons.metadata_jsonb
```json
{
  "proactive_preferences": {
    "frequency": "daily" | "weekly" | "off",
    "last_proactive_sent": "2025-10-24T10:00:00Z",
    "preference_asked_at": "2025-10-23T09:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Message Flow Diagrams

### Reminder Creation Flow
```
User: "Remind me to call John tomorrow at 3pm"
  ↓
Slack receives message → SlackUserIntegration
  ↓
Orchestrator.process_message()
  ↓
_determine_intent() → "reminder_create"
  ↓
ReminderManagementAgent.process_reminder_request()
  ↓
Claude parses: {action: "Call John", scheduled_datetime: "2025-10-25T15:00:00"}
  ↓
Creates reminder_rule in database
  ↓
Responds: "Got it! I'll remind you to Call John tomorrow at 3:00 PM."
```

### Reminder Delivery Flow
```
ReminderWorker (runs every 5 minutes)
  ↓
ReminderAgent.scan_and_send_reminders()
  ↓
Queries reminder_rules WHERE sent_at IS NULL AND scheduled_datetime <= NOW()
  ↓
For each pending reminder:
  - Generates contextual message using Claude
  - ProactiveMessagingService.send_to_person()
    → Gets user's Slack comm_identity
    → Opens DM channel
    → Sends message via Slack
    → Saves to database
  - Marks reminder_rule.sent_at = NOW()
```

### Proactive Message Flow
```
ProactiveWorker (runs daily)
  ↓
ProactiveAgent.scan_and_send_proactive_messages()
  ↓
For each active user:
  - Check proactive_preferences.frequency
  - Check last_proactive_sent (respect frequency window)
  - Build full context (dates, projects, conversations)
  - Ask Claude to analyze for opportunities
  - If opportunity found:
    → ProactiveMessagingService.send_to_person()
    → Update last_proactive_sent timestamp
```

## Testing Guide

### 1. Test Reminder Creation (Natural Language)

**Test Case 1: Simple scheduled reminder**
```
User: "Remind me to call Sarah in 2 hours"
Expected:
- Orchestrator detects "reminder_create" intent
- ReminderManagementAgent parses the request
- Creates reminder_rule with scheduled_datetime = now + 2 hours
- Responds: "Got it! I'll remind you to call Sarah at [time]."
```

**Test Case 2: Date-based reminder**
```
User: "Remind me about John's birthday 2 weeks before"
Expected:
- Creates/finds date_item for "John's birthday"
- Creates reminder_rule with reminder_type=lead_time, lead_time_days=14
- Responds: "Perfect! I'll remind you about John's birthday 14 days in advance."
```

**Test Case 3: Ambiguous request**
```
User: "Remind me about that thing"
Expected:
- Claude sets needs_clarification=true
- Responds: "What would you like to be reminded about?"
```

**Test Case 4: List reminders**
```
User: "Show my reminders"
Expected:
- Lists all pending reminders with dates/times
```

### 2. Test Reminder Delivery

**Setup:**
```python
# Manually create a reminder for testing
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

reminder_data = {
    'reminder_rule_id': str(uuid4()),
    'org_id': 'your-org-id',
    'date_item_id': None,  # Generic reminder
    'comm_identity_id': 'user-comm-identity-id',
    'reminder_type': 'scheduled',
    'scheduled_datetime': (datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=2)).isoformat(),
    'metadata_jsonb': {
        'action': 'Test reminder delivery',
        'user_request': 'Test'
    },
    'created_at': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
}
# Insert into database
```

**Expected:**
- Within 5 minutes (next reminder worker run), user receives Slack DM
- Message is contextual and includes the action
- reminder_rule.sent_at is updated

### 3. Test Proactive Messages

**Manual Trigger (for testing):**
```python
# Run proactive scan manually
from app.database import get_db_context
from app.agents.proactive import ProactiveAgent

with get_db_context() as db:
    agent = ProactiveAgent(db)
    agent.scan_and_send_proactive_messages()
```

**Expected Behaviors:**

**First Run (No preference set):**
- User receives message asking about frequency preference
- Metadata updated with preference_asked_at

**Subsequent Runs:**
- Respects frequency setting (daily/weekly/off)
- Only sends if within frequency window
- Looks for genuine opportunities (upcoming dates, stale projects)
- Sends contextual, helpful suggestions

### 4. Test Orchestrator Intent Routing

**Test each intent:**
```
"Remind me tomorrow" → reminder_create → ReminderManagementAgent
"Show my reminders" → reminder_list → ReminderManagementAgent
"Recommend a restaurant" → recommendation → RecommendationAgent
"Help me plan an event" → project_management → ProjectManagementAgent
"What's the weather?" → general → Orchestrator
```

### 5. Integration Test (End-to-End)

**Scenario: Complete reminder lifecycle**
1. User sends: "Remind me to call mom in 5 minutes"
2. Bot responds: "Got it! I'll remind you to call mom at [time]."
3. Wait 5+ minutes (or trigger reminder worker)
4. User receives reminder in Slack DM
5. Check database: reminder_rule.sent_at is populated

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env`:
```bash
# Background Workers
REMINDER_CHECK_INTERVAL=300  # 5 minutes (in seconds)
PROACTIVE_CHECK_INTERVAL=86400  # 24 hours (in seconds)

# For testing, use shorter intervals:
# REMINDER_CHECK_INTERVAL=60  # 1 minute
# PROACTIVE_CHECK_INTERVAL=3600  # 1 hour
```

### User Preferences

Users can set their proactive message frequency:
```
User: "daily" or "weekly" or "off"
Bot: "Got it! I'll send proactive suggestions [frequency]."
```

This is stored in `persons.metadata_jsonb.proactive_preferences.frequency`

## Monitoring & Logs

### Key Log Messages

**Reminder Creation:**
```
[INFO] Detected intent: reminder_create
[INFO] Processing reminder request: person_id=...
[INFO] Created reminder rule: reminder_id=...
```

**Reminder Delivery:**
```
[INFO] Running reminder scan
[INFO] Found X pending reminders
[INFO] Sending reminder: person_id=..., date_item=...
[INFO] Reminder sent successfully: reminder_id=...
```

**Proactive Messages:**
```
[INFO] Running proactive message scan
[INFO] Checking proactive opportunity for person_id=...
[INFO] Sent proactive message: person_id=..., opportunity_type=...
[INFO] Proactive message scan completed: messages_sent=X
```

### Error Handling

All components include comprehensive error handling:
- Failed reminders are NOT marked as sent (will retry next scan)
- Proactive message errors are logged but don't crash worker
- Slack delivery errors are caught and logged with context

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ReminderWorker: Scans every 5 minutes (configurable)
- ProactiveWorker: Scans every 24 hours (configurable)
- Both workers run in daemon threads (non-blocking)

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Database Indexing:**
   - Add index on `reminder_rules.scheduled_datetime` (already exists)
   - Add index on `reminder_rules.sent_at`

2. **Batch Processing:**
   - Current: Processes users one by one
   - Future: Batch users for parallel processing

3. **Caching:**
   - Cache user preferences in Redis
   - Cache comm_identities for faster lookup

## Future Enhancements

### Near-Term (Not Implemented)
1. **Canvas Integration:**
   - Send rich proactive messages via Slack Canvas
   - Include interactive elements (buttons, forms)

2. **Email & SMS Delivery:**
   - Complete implementation of email via SES
   - Add SMS support via Twilio

3. **Recurring Reminders:**
   - Full iCal RRULE support for complex recurrence
   - "Remind me every Monday at 9am"

4. **Snooze Functionality:**
   - User can snooze reminders: "remind me in 1 hour"
   - Update scheduled_datetime instead of marking sent

### Long-Term
1. **ML-Based Timing:**
   - Learn optimal times to send proactive messages
   - Personalize based on user engagement patterns

2. **Smart Grouping:**
   - Combine multiple reminders into single message
   - "Here are 3 things you asked me to remind you about..."

3. **Follow-Up Detection:**
   - Detect if user acted on reminder
   - Send follow-up if needed

4. **Reminder Analytics:**
   - Track completion rates
   - Identify patterns in user preferences

## Troubleshooting

### Reminders Not Being Created
**Check:**
1. Orchestrator intent detection: Look for "Detected intent: reminder_create" in logs
2. ReminderManagementAgent parsing: Check for JSON parse errors
3. Database permissions: Ensure service can write to `reminder_rules`

### Reminders Not Being Sent
**Check:**
1. ReminderWorker is running: Look for "Running reminder scan" logs
2. Reminder scheduled_datetime is in the past
3. Slack integration is active: Check for Slack connection errors
4. ProactiveMessagingService errors: Look for "Failed to send" logs

### Proactive Messages Not Sending
**Check:**
1. User preference: Check `persons.metadata_jsonb.proactive_preferences.frequency`
2. Frequency window: Check `last_proactive_sent` timestamp
3. ProactiveWorker is running: Look for "Running proactive message scan" logs
4. Claude finding opportunities: Check decision reasoning in logs

### Intent Not Being Detected
**Check:**
1. Keyword matching in Orchestrator._determine_intent()
2. Try different phrasings: "remind me", "set a reminder"
3. Check logs for "Detected intent" message
